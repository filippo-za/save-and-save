# React Native Applicatione - Save and Save

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a project that I did during start2impact. The project consists in the realization of an application that has as its theme the fight against waste.

## The Application 

The application was built with React Native. I used Android Studio as a development environment and to configure React Native I used React Native CLI, so no EXPO.

## Project structure

### Folders 

The project was divided into four folders
principal:

- Assets -> contains the images and icons of the
project

- Components -> contains the various components
reusable by React

- Contents -> a folder that contains the files
main of the application, in such a way as to
facilitate "import" on other pages.

- Display -> contains the two pages
application: Home and Details.

### Interior of the application

The application as described above,
has two main pages: the Home
and Details. The application comes with a header, where you can search for the local.

Still in the Home, we can scroll through the various rooms and view the name, street and price of the product. We also have a button that says "Save Food"

By clicking on "save food" on the page
Home, you land on the Details page:
here we find more info about the restaurant and the
food to save
